        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  -   **Learning Patterns:** During training, weights are adjusted to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the true output. The network learns which input features are more important based on the data by increasing or decreasing the corresponding weights.\n",

By adding a bias term, the network can adjust the decision boundary and achieve better performance.\n",

        "2. **Rank Classes by Probability:** Softmax ranks the predicted classes by probability, allowing the model to select the class with the highest probability as the predicted label. The class with the highest softmax score corresponds to the most likely class according to the model.\n",

        "3. **Handle Multiple Classes:** Softmax is specifically designed for multi-class classification tasks. It assigns a probability to each class, enabling the model to handle situations where the input can belong to one of several categories. Unlike other activation functions, softmax ensures that the sum of the probabilities across all classes is 1, making it ideal for classification.\n",

Softmax makes it easier to compute the gradients needed for backpropagation by ensuring that the output probabilities are differentiable and suitable for comparison with the true class labels."

        "1. **Vanishing Gradient**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Problem:** In deep networks, gradients can become extremely small as they are propagated back through many layers, especially when using certain activation functions like the sigmoid or tanh. This results in very slow learning for the earlier layers (closer to the input), effectively \"stalling\" their training.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Exploding Gradients**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Problem:** he opposite of the vanishing gradient problem, exploding gradients occur when gradients become excessively large as they are propagated back through the layers. This can cause the model parameters to update too drastically, leading to instability or divergence in training.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Solution**\n",
