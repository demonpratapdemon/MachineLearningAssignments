        "  * Easy to Implement: K-means is straightforward to understand and implement.\n",

        "2. **Sensitivity to Initialization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * K-means can converge to different solutions depending on the initial positions of the centroids. Poor initialization can lead to suboptimal clustering results. Techniques like **K-means++** can help mitigate this issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Assumption of Spherical Clusters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * K-means assumes that clusters are spherical and evenly sized, which can be a limitation if the data has clusters of different shapes or densities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Not Suitable for Non-Convex Clusters:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * K-means may fail to correctly cluster data that has non-convex shapes or varying densities, as it tends to split such clusters incorrectly.\n",

        "\n",
        "  * K-means is sensitive to outliers and noisy data, as they can distort the mean of the clusters and lead to poor clustering results.\n",

        "6. **Hard Assignment:**\n",
        "\n",
