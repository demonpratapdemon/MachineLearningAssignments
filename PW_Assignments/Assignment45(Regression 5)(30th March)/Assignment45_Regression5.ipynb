    "**Elastic Net Regression** is a hybrid regression technique that combines both **Lasso (L1 regularization)** and **Ridge (L2 regularization)** regression methods. It's designed to overcome some limitations present in both Lasso and Ridge regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net differs in the follwoing ways wrt other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective Function:** Since it combines both Ridge and Lasso regression in the objective function, it uses 2 main parameters - one is the constant $\\alpha$ that gets multiplied with the penalty function and another term **l1_ratio** which determines the ratio in which it will apply weight for both Ridge and Lasso Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complexity:** Elastic Net regression is more complex compared to either Lasso or Ridge regression, since it provides a combination of both and as a result, the time complexity also increases."

    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation:** Utilize k-fold cross-validation techniques to assess model performance across different values of lambda. This involves dividing the dataset into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different subset held out for validation. The lambda value that results in the best average performance across these iterations is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grid Search:** Implement a grid search where a predefined range of lambda values is tested exhaustively. This method involves training the model with different lambda values and evaluating each model's performance. The lambda value that yields the best performance is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Randomized Search:** Similar to grid search, but instead of testing all possible values, a randomized search tests a random subset of possible values within a defined range. This can be more efficient, especially when dealing with a large range of potential lambda values."

    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Zero Coefficients:** Like Lasso, Elastic Net can force some coefficients to be exactly zero. Non-zero coefficients in Elastic Net indicate the importance of the corresponding features. A non-zero coefficient suggests that the feature is influential in predicting the target variable. The magnitude of the coefficient reflects the strength of that influence: larger coefficients indicate a stronger impact on the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Zero Coefficients:** Just as in Lasso, a coefficient reduced to zero in Elastic Net implies that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model. Elastic Net, due to the combined penalties, might zero out some coefficients that Lasso would and some that Ridge would, resulting in a compromise between both techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Magnitude Comparison:** Comparing the magnitudes of non-zero coefficients can provide insights into which features have a more significant impact on the model's predictions. Larger coefficients typically suggest a more substantial influence, while smaller coefficients imply a weaker impact."

    "Elastic Net Regression inherently performs feature selection by combining Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization) penalties in its objective function. This combination allows Elastic Net to handle multicollinearity and perform variable selection, which is particularly useful when there are many correlated features. Examine the coefficients obtained from the Elastic Net model. The coefficients will be shrunk towards zero due to the regularization, and some will be reduced to exactly zero. Features with non-zero coefficients are considered selected by the model and deemed important for predictions. And those with 0 coefficients can be filtered out and hence Elastic Net Regression is used for feature selection."
